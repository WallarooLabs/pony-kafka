# Pony-Kafka

Welcome to Pony Kafka. 

This is a pure kafka client written in Pony. The goal is to eventually reach feature parity with the official kafka client.

# Why

The main reason this exists is because the alternatives weren't necessarily going to be clean/easy to integrate into Pony and its normal "async everything" manner of working.

# Building

You currently need the latest Wallaroo Labs version of Pony (https://github.com/WallarooLabs/ponyc). Mainline Pony compatibility is already planned for the near future.

You also need the following (in addition to what is needed for Pony itself):

* LZ4
* Snappy
* Zlib

For Ubuntu 16.04 or newer you can run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev liblz4-dev zlib1g-dev
```

For older Ubuntu you can run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev
cd /tmp
wget -O liblz4-1.7.5.tar.gz https://github.com/lz4/lz4/archive/v1.7.5.tar.gz
tar zxvf liblz4-1.7.5.tar.gz
cd lz4-1.7.5
sudo make install
```

For OSX you can run:

```bash
brew install snappy lz4
```

# Current status

This is currently alpha quality software that still needs more work before it is production ready.

You currently need the latest Wallaroo Labs version of Pony (https://github.com/WallarooLabs/ponyc). Mainline Pony compatibility is already planned for the near future.
